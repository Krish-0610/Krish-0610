## About Me

I'm a Computer Science Engineering student who learns by building. I'm passionate about solving real-world problems using clean, efficient code. I’m currently focused on mastering backend development, while also diving deep into applied machine learning.

I value execution over theory. I don’t just follow tutorials—I break things, fix them, and rebuild better systems. I’m building a strong foundation in system design, data structures & algorithms, and production-level coding.

##  Core Interests

-  Applied Machine Learning (real-world use cases only)
-  Backend Development (Python, REST APIs, auth systems)
-  Systems Thinking (from MVPs to scalable solutions)

---

##  Projects I'm Building

- **Auth System (In Progress)**  
  A full-featured user authentication backend with role-based access, JWT, and OAuth2.

- **AI/ML Pipeline (Planned)**  
  Building an end-to-end ML system: data ingestion → model training → API deployment (FastAPI + Docker).
  
- **More coming** – Projects that solve actual problems, not tutorial based
